# CYB
PHP code to Connect Your Books

Under construction.

This gateway will let you connect various data sources and sinks for bookkeeping data in the domains of:
* time tracking
* issue tracking
* invoicing
* mutual credit networks
* budget tracking

The name CYB stands for "Connect Your Books" and is pronounced like the Dutch name 'Sieb', or the English verb 'seep' (as it lets data seep through the network).

See [Federated Bookkeeping](https://federatedbookkeeping.org) for more info on the vision behind it.
