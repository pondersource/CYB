Two-way sync ideas:

1. Merge information as stated by different users in order to have 1 truth that supports multiples truths (e.g: Manuel said X, Michiel said Y);
2. Maybe expose a Github interface;
2.1. One-layer for state
2.2. One-layer for history of state changes
2.3. One layer for merge operations
3. Use an additional node containing an external truth to sync nodes. Differences are made by comparing to this node.
