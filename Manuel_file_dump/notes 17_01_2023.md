Two-way sync ideas:

1. Merge information as stated by different users in order to have 1 truth that supports multiples truths (e.g: Manuel said X, Michiel said Y);
2. Maybe expose a Github interface: One-layer for state; One-layer for history of state changes; One layer for merge operations.
3. Use an additional node containing an external truth to sync nodes. Differences are made by comparing to this node.
