**Federation** – Group of systems which share data in peer-to-peer transmissions across nodes while each maintains sovereignty and authority over its own data. To be a full member of a federated system the node must be able to:

1. Receive data from at least one second member
2. Send data to at least one third member
3. Forward data without causing duplication
4. Comply with the federation rules (???) for privacy, transparency, trust, editing, access, versioning, integrity, confidienciality,...

Members of a federated system can be connected to non-federated members. Non-federated members which are part of the system can:

1. Receive data from only one member
2. Send data to only one member

Members of a federated system only know their neighbours.
(They are aware to some degree of other members in the federation???)

**(Data) Sovereignty** – Ability to choose the access rights of other nodes in federation, thus being able to arbitrarily veto external accesses and modifications to its own data.

**Trust** – Quantification of the reliability/accuracy (???) of data being received from a neighboring node.
