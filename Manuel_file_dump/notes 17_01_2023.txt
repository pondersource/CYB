Two-way sync:

Maybe merge information as stated by different users in order to have 1 truth that supports multiples truths (e.g: Manuel said X, Michiel said Y);

Maybe expose a Github interface;
One-layer for state
One-layer for history of state changes
One layer for merge operations

Use an additional node containing an external truth to sync nodes. Differences are made by comparing to this node.
