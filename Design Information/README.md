# Description

The goal in this project is to automate the syncronization of data across different apps where the formats aren't identical. Doing so requires assuming that the data in both ends relates to the same real-world task (billing, task-tracking, calendar), from where some meta-knowledge can be derived.

The main idea for doing so consists of translating each different format into a common structure, which is used to compare the data stored in each database. From these versions it is possible to compare what is being presented on each end, and with some additional logic this comparison results in a sequence of instructions (ADD, REMOVE, UPDATE) to be executed on each one.

# Requirements

1. Live-data sharing with simultaneous editing.
2. One-way and two-way synchronization.
3. Ensure privacy and sovereignty for all members.
4. Resilience to routing changes and failed deliveries.
