# options:
# 1. phpredis
# 2. predis
# phpredis is a php extension (written in c) and predis a php package (written in php).
# Based on many benchmarks like the mentioned link below, phpredis is about 6 times faster
# than predis. it's recommended to use phpredis if performance is a concern to your service.
# https://medium.com/@akalongman/phpredis-vs-predis-comparison-on-real-production-data-a819b48cbadb
#
#  however if you're on a shared hosting, the only option would probably be predis as a php package.
